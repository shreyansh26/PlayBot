This is a personal Chatbot I created on the Facebook Messenger platform.

I used Motion.AI for preparing this chatbot.
The chatbot uses NLP to interact with the user and play games with the user. The game code uses a webhook made using Webtask.io. Also the chatbot stores data taken from the user (email address) in a MongoDB database. The webhook used for the same is made using Webtask.io, the code for which is in the repo.

The name of the Facebook page is PlayBot, although the page isn't public yet.
